# pacapt-go

## Introduction

`pacapt` is a wrapper for many package managers with pacman-style command syntax.

_Note: To start with, we choose to focus on `homebrew`. Support for more package managers will be added Soonâ„¢._

Use one syntax to rule them all!

## Warning: WIP

This is an experimental port of [icy/pacapt] in Golang. We choose Golang for better readability, better testing, and hopefully without loss of portability.

Now the implementations of different package managers are all placed in `dispatch` package, with names like `impl_xxx.go`.

To play along at home:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rami3l/pacapt-go.git
cd pacapt-go
```

... and then try something like:

```bash
go run main.go -S curl
```

## Installation

```bash
# To install
go install "github.com/rami3l/pacapt-go"

# To uninstall
go clean -i "github.com/rami3l/pacapt-go"
```

We currently provide `go install` only.
PPAs might be added when appropriate.

## Implemented Features

- `Homebrew` support: Experimental, with automatic `brew cask` invocation implemented for `-S`, `-R`, `-Su`, and more.
  
    ```bash
    go run main.go -S curl --dryrun
    >> brew install curl

    go run main.go -S gimp --dryrun
    >> brew cask install gimp
    ```

- `Chocolatey` support: Experimental. Don't forget to run in an elevated shell!

- `Dpkg/Apt` support: Experimental.

- `--dryrun`: Use this flag to just print out the command to be executed (sometimes with a --dry-run flag to activate the package manager's dryrun option).

    Some query commands might still be run, but anything "big" should have been stopped from running, eg. installation.

    For instance:

    ```bash
    # Nothing will be deleted here:
    pacapt-go -Sc --dryrun
    >> brew cleanup --dry-run
    .. (showing the files to be removed)

    # Without `--dryrun`, everything will work as shown above:
    pacapt-go -Sc
    >> brew cleanup
    .. (cleaning up)
    ```
